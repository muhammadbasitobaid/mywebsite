                    <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>3 months after writing my Hello World program on 17 September 2018 (while working in the marketing department) I convinced by to boss to take a stab at building a better version of outdated labrotary management system my company was running on. </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we knew it I transitioned from our old one to mine. My newbie self was now incharge of hosting hundred of thousand of lab sample and supporting thousands of clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm someone who get excited by challenges I always try my best as much as I can to improve in terms of literally everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

                    <p>Reverse Engineer and Build ugly Prototypes first.</p>
                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why the things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After almost two years of supporting my sytem at the lab I'm ready to learn something new. I'll be collabrating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) & Youtube Channel. </p>
                    <p>Aside from building side projects I would Love to enter a position where I can be a part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself. </p>
